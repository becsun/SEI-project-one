The aim of the game is to shoot the hair 'goo' at the the on coming clients before they reach the other side or into the hand of 'goo.' Be careful to not get hit my their tears otherwise the game will be over.

![function](readmeAssets/goo-funtion.png)
<br>
This function snippet if for the clients moving to the edge of the page and returning back to the other side. Took me a while to figure this out.


## :confounded: Challenges
As the layout is set as a grid, it took me a bit of time to work out how to move both from left to right and right to left. Another challenge i had was working out how to fire the 'goo' and to replace the images from a person to a money bill then to an empty cell.

##  :bug:  Bugs
- Ran out of time to implement the logic to restart the game. Instead, used `window.location.reload()` to restart the page.
- The game still continues even though the client hits the hand with the tube of colour and also when they reach the end of the page.

## :trophy: Wins
Happy with what i had accomplished for my first project after 3 weeks into the course. Was an achievement to have a worked alone and ended with although a little buggy, a working game. Enjoyed the overall experience.
