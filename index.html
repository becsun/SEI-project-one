   <h2 class="heading">Hair-goo</h2>
      <h3 class="blurb">The object of the game is to make money by shooting hair colour with your tube of colour while avoiding client's tears and also preventing a stampede. 

        <br>SPACE INVADER TIPS:
        The clients cry randomly and their tears flow down the screen. If the tears hits you, you lose money£?. If all the clients are sttended to, you win and the game is over. If any clients reach the bottom of the screen the game ends, and you lose.
        
        <br>GAME FUNDAMENTALS
        The clientss travel sideways and each time they touch the side they drop down 1 line. 
        
        There is no time limit, except for the fact that if you do not shoot them all before they reach the bottom of the screen the game ends.
        
        <!-- The more client the player shoots, the faster the remaining clients move. The last client moves very quickly. -->

        <br>Good Luck
