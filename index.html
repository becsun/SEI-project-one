      <h3>The object of the game is to make money by shooting hair colour with your tube of colour while avoiding client's tears and also preventing a stampede. 

        SPACE INVADER TIPS:
        The clients cry randomly and their tears flow down the screen. If the tears hits you, you lose money£?. If all the clients are sttended to, you win and the game is over. If any clients reach the bottom of the screen the game ends, and you lose.
        
        GAME FUNDAMENTALS
        The clientss travel sideways and each time they touch the side they drop down 1 line. 
        
        There is no time limit, except for the fact that if you do not shoot them all before they reach the bottom of the screen the game ends.
        
        The more client the player shoots, the faster the remaining clients move. The last client moves very quickly.

        Good Luck
        </h3>
