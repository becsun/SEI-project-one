      <h3 class="blurb">The object of the game is to make money by squirting your tube of colour while avoiding client's tears and also preventing the stampede. 

        <br>SPACE INVADER TIPS:
        The clients cry randomly and their tears flow down the screen. If the tears hits you, money will be deducted. If all the clients are attended to, you win and the game is over. If any clients reach the bottom of the screen the game ends, and you lose.
        
        <br>GAME KEYS:
        Use the F key to squirt and the arrow keys to move left to right.
        
        There is no time limit, except for the fact that if you do not shoot them all before they reach the bottom of the screen the game ends.
